# Socially-Distant Lotto Picker

Powerball Lottery picker that keeps at least 6 numbers between each whiteball at all times.

I figured that I might as well have a bit of fun while we're all stuck.

Kind of an odd little project that grew out of observations about the nature of "random" versus "human random".


At the moment, use Python's built-in IDE to run it. (Should run without IDE, but just to be sure)

Open for work btw, entry-level work as well. FYI
