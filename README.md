# SociallyDistantLottoPicker

Powerball Lottery picker that keeps at least 6 numbers between each whiteball at all times.

Kind of an odd little project that grew out of observations about the nature of "random" versus "human random".
I figured that I might as well have a bit of fun while we're all stuck.
